# PARTY HOUSE - Alien Party

This is a student project as a part of my graduate studies course in game programming in which we replicate a game written entirely in C.

*Anecdote: This project's original instruction was to find and replicate an old arcade game. I kept bouncing off of various games because I had trouble relating to them. At the time I was very interested in roguelike deck-builder games like Slay the Spire and Loop Hero. Around the same time, I discovered the UFO50 game pack, which I cannot recommend enough to anyone reading this! [Check it out here!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147860/UFO_50/). This is a fan-made game created to replicate one of the many awesome games found within that pack. I do not claim to own the original concept of the game or any assets from the UFO50 title.*

## About
Our final project in my graduate programming course consisted of utilizing a basic OpenGL framework and developing our own implementation of game and system features. Generally recommended to create a remake of an older 8 or 16 bit pixel game. I wanted to replicate a very UI focused deck builder, which involved a number of relatively complex features such as contextual input callbacks and a font atlas. In my final semester, I've decided to work through this project again and apply all that I've learned since I made this.
